Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with: Arista Networks’ limited operating history; risks associated with Arista Networks’ rapid growth; Arista Networks’ customer concentration; Arista Networks’ dispute with Cisco Systems, Inc. including Arista Networks’ ability to obtain a determination that alternative product implementations are not covered by remedial orders and our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain including the sourcing of components on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; risks associated with our customer’s adoption of our redesigned products and services and requests for more favorable terms and conditions; declines in the sales prices of our products and services; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; increased competition in our products and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; the evolution of the cloud networking market and the adoption by end customers of Arista Networks’ cloud networking solutions; Arista’s dispute with OptumSoft; and general market, political, economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect Arista Networks can be found in Arista’s Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016, and other filings that the company makes to the SEC from time to time. You can locate these reports through our website at <a href=\"http://investors.arista.com/company/investors-relations/investors-home/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://investors.arista.com</a>&nbsp;and on the SEC’s website at <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">www.sec.gov</a>. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof and Arista Networks disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>\n<p>The company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.</p>\n<p>Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP net income, net income per diluted share, gross margin, or operating margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.</p>\n<p>The Company’s guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The Company has not reconciled its non-GAAP gross margin or its non-GAAP operating margin guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin, because we do not provide guidance on GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin or the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of stock-based compensation in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 will have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.</p>\n<p><strong>About Arista Networks</strong></p>\n<p>Arista Networks was founded to pioneer and deliver software-driven cloud networking solutions for large datacenter storage and computing environments.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our future performance, including statements in the section entitled “Financial Outlook,” such as estimates regarding revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, statements regarding the adoption of cloud networking by our customers at an unprecedented pace, and statements regarding the benefits from the introduction of Arista AlgoMatch™ and the Arista 7160 Series platforms. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with: Arista Networks’ limited operating history; risks associated with Arista Networks’ rapid growth; Arista Networks’ customer concentration; Arista Networks’ dispute with Cisco Systems, Inc. including Arista Networks’ ability to obtain a determination that alternative product implementations are not covered by remedial orders and our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain including the sourcing of components on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; risks associated with our customer’s adoption of our redesigned products and services and requests for more favorable terms and conditions; declines in the sales prices of our products and services; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; increased competition in our products and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; the evolution of the cloud networking market and the adoption by end customers of Arista Networks’ cloud networking solutions; Arista’s dispute with OptumSoft; and general market, political, economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect Arista Networks can be found in Arista’s Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016, and other filings that the company makes to the SEC from time to time. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.arista.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof and Arista Networks disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP net income, net income per diluted share, gross margin, or operating margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. The Company’s guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The Company has not reconciled its non-GAAP gross margin or its non-GAAP operating margin guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin, because we do not provide guidance on GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin or the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of stock-based compensation in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 will have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

Arista AlgoMatch provides customers with more flexible and scalable solutions for access control, telemetry and secure cloud networking. The workload and workflow flexibility requirements of today's cloud networks mean that the underlying infrastructure must be free of the limitations of rigid network policy control mechanisms. Traditional network policy engines in switch and router solutions struggle to address the challenges of scale, impose rigidity on resource allocation and limit the number of enforcement operations. This results in limited flow visibility and inflexible network policy enforcement. By combining general purpose memory technology with advanced software algorithms, Arista AlgoMatch provides more scale, performance and efficiency compared to standard implementations of costly and purpose-built TCAMs (Ternary Content Addressable Memories) commonly used in traditional silicon chipset architecture. AlgoMatch provides a packet matching algorithm that enables flow matching for access control, policy and visibility. Benefits include a high performance network policy engine with increased functionality and scale delivered in a cost and power efficient manner. New Programmable Platforms at 25/100GbE As data centers increase bandwidth speeds to keep up with the massive flow of data coming through the cloud, they must also balance the capital and operational expenditures associated with moving to next-generation networks. 25GbE offers the benefits of enhanced compute and storage efficiency at a long-term cost structure similar to 10GbE. The Arista 7160 Series is available in three models, all featuring 25/100GbE ports. The new platform delivers operational consistency and automated efficiency through the same common Arista EOS® (Extensible Operating System) and CloudVision® software. “25GbE offers a 2.5X performance improvement over 10GbE at a significant price-per-gigabit discount while using the same cabling infrastructure,” said Seamus Crehan, president of Crehan Research. “Unrelenting traffic growth, large scale cloud adoption and the recent release of the IEEE standard are already starting to drive the demand for server networking upgrades to speeds of 25, 50 and 100GbE where we expect combined shipments to surpass two million ports by 2017. This, in-turn, is fueling the strong demand for next generation 25GbE and 100GbE switches.” The Arista 7160 Series are high performance data center platforms delivering support for a programmable forwarding pipeline and flexible profiles for up to 6.4Tbps and 24MB of dynamic packet buffer in a set of compact systems. AlgoMatch for richer support for more flexible access control, traffic control and telemetry at 2-6x the scale of traditional methods with up to 50% lower power. Flexible Profiles offer a range of custom profiles allocating common resources optimally for the desired network topology with lower complexity for both cloud and enterprise customers who frequently hit limitations with more rigid systems. Unique programmable pipeline accommodates support for the addition of new encapsulations and overlay technologies allowing the same system to be used in multiple roles, extending life-cycles and allow rapid deployment. Fully shared 24MB packet buffer that is available to all ports. Dynamic buffer management is designed for both speed changes, microbursts or sustained network congestion. The 7160 Series is available in three models: 7160-32CQ - 32 x 100GbE, 1RU, or 128 x 25GbE with 6.4Tbps of performance 7160-48YC6 - 48 x 25GbE, 6 x 100GbE with 3.6Tbps of performance 7160-48TC6 - 48 x 10GbE BASE-T, 6 x 100GbE and 2.16Tbps of performance Availability and Pricing AlgoMatch will ship on the Arista 7160 Series in Q1 2017. The Arista 7160 Series are orderable now, shipping in Q1 2017 with pricing comparable to the 7050X and 7060X Series.

2016年11月3日、カリフォルニア州サンタクララ発 - 大規模なデータセンターとコンピューティング環境に特化したSDCN（Software Driven Cloud Networking）ソリューションのリーディング・カンパニーであるArista Networks, Inc.（NYSE：ANET）は本日、第3四半期（2016年9月30日まで）の業績を発表いたしました。 第3四半期の財務指標のハイライト 売上高は2億9,030万ドルでした。（2016年第2四半期比で8.0%増、2015年第3四半期比で33.4%増） GAAPベースの粗利益率は64.2%でした。（2016年第2四半期のGAAPベースの粗利益率は63.8%、2015年第3四半期は65.2%でした。） 非GAAPベースの粗利益率は64.6%でした。（2016年第2四半期の非GAAPベースの粗利益率は64.2%、2015年第3四半期は65.5%でした。） GAAPベースの純利益は5,130万ドル、希薄化後1株当たり利益は0.69ドルでした。（2015年第3四半期は、GAAPベースの純利益は2,870万ドル、希薄化後1株当たり利益は0.39ドルでした。） 非GAAPベースの純利益は6,120万ドル、希薄化後1株当たり利益は0.83ドルでした。（2015年第3四半期は、非GAAPベースの純利益は4,240万ドル、希薄化後1株当たり利益は0.59ドルでした。） Arista Networksの社長兼CEO、Jayshree Ullalは次のように述べています。「2016年第3四半期の売上高が過去最高を記録し、クラウド・ネットワーキング用のポートが累計出荷数1,000万台を達成したことをうれしく思います。この好業績は、新しい7000シリーズが当社のお客様に高く評価され、レガシーからクラウド・ネットワーキングへの必然的な切り替えが進んだことを強く反映しています」 Arista NetworksのCFO（最高財務責任者）、Ita Brennanlは次のように述べています。「第3四半期における希薄化後1株当たりの売上高と収益には満足しています。これは幅広い層のお客様から当社の製品への大きな引き合いがあったことを表すものです」 企業活動のハイライト ネットワーク規模でワークロード、ワークフロー、およびワークストリームを深部まで可視化して、日常業務のスピードアップと運用コストの削減を促進するため、Arista EOS®とCloudVision®を活用する、次世代のリアルタイムテレメトリーおよび分析の機能を導入しました。 昨年の6月に発表したHPEコンバージドアーキテクチャをさらに拡張する、画期的な新戦略パートナーシップをHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)と結びました。HPEのユーザとパートナーは、アリスタネットワークスのスイッチ製品をHPEから直接購入できるようになります(2016年11月7日より提供開始)。これにより、業界をリードするソフトウェア主導型のインフラを基盤とする、セキュアなハイブリッドITソリューションとエクスペリエンスをより多くの方に紹介できます。 業績見通し 2016年第4四半期の業績予想は次のとおりです。 売上高は3億1,000万～3億2,000万ドルと予想しています。 非GAAPベースの粗利益率は61～64%と予想しています。 非GAAPベースの営業利益率は約26%と予想しています。 非GAAPベースの財務指標の業績見通しは、OptumSoftおよびCiscoとの訴訟に伴う費用（約1,200万ドル）、株式報酬、およびその他の非経常的費用を除きます。非GAAPベースの業績見通しの指標値を、それに相当するGAAPベースの指標値に照らして調整することは、将来予想に基づく形では不可能です（詳しい説明は以下をご覧ください）。 将来予想に関する記述 このプレスリリースには、当社の今後の業績についての「将来予想に関する記述」が含まれています。これには、「業績見通し」セクションに記述した、2016年第4四半期の売上高、非GAAPベースの粗利益率、非GAAPベースの営業利益率に関する予想の記述、クラウド・ネットワーキングへの継続的な転換に関する記述、次世代の遠隔データ測定および分析の機能の発表の効果に関する記述が含まれます。将来予想に関する記述には、さまざまな不確実性とリスクが伴うことから、実際の結果は、将来予想に関する記述で想定したものとは大きく異なる可能性があります。これには以下に伴うリスクが該当します。「Arista Networksの限られた事業活動の歴史。Arista Networksの急成長に伴うリスク。Arista Networksの顧客集中度。Arista NetworksとCisco Systems, Inc.との訴訟（代替製品の導入が是正命令に含まれないとの決定をArista Networksが得られるかどうかを含む）。Arista NetworksとOptumSoft, Inc.との訴訟。大口顧客が価格の譲歩や有利な契約条件を求める動き。当社製品とサービスの販売価格の下落。顧客の発注パターンや顧客構成の変化。当社の製品とサービスの市場（データセンター市場など）での競争の激化。新しい製品や標準の投入と市場での受け入れに対する依存。技術や市場の急速な変化。クラウド・ネットワーキング市場の進化と、エンドユーザーによるArista Networksのクラウド・ネットワーキング・ソリューションの受け入れ。市場、政治、経済、ビジネスに関する全般的な状況」。Arista Networksに影響する可能性があるその他のリスクや不確実性については、Form 10-Qに基づいて2016年8月5日に米証券取引委員会（SEC）に提出したAristaの四半期報告書、および当社がSECに随時提出するその他の書類に記載されています。これらの書類は、当社のWebサイト（http://investors.arista.com）またはSECのWebサイト（http://www.sec.gov）で参照できます。このプレスリリースの将来予想に関する記述はすべて、当文書の日付の時点で当社が入手可能な情報に基づいています。Arista Networksは、将来予想に関する記述について、その作成日以降に発生した現象または出現した状況に応じて記述を公に更新または修正する義務を負わないものとします。 非GAAPベースの財務指標について 当社が発表する所定の非GAAPベースの財務指標は、株式報酬費用、OptumSoftおよびCiscoとの訴訟に伴う費用、およびその他の非経常的費用を除きます。当社は、これらの非GAAPベースの財務指標を社内で決算結果の分析に利用しています。そして、これらの非GAAPベースの財務指標を利用することは、継続的な事業成績や傾向を評価するための追加的な手段として投資家の皆様にとって有益であるものと考えています。また、これらの財務指標は、経営陣が今後の期間の計画と予測の基盤として利用している、主たる指標です。 非GAAPベースの財務指標は、対応するGAAPベースの純利益、1株当たり純利益、粗利益率、および営業利益率と別個に検討するためのものではなく、また代理の指標となるものでもありません。非GAAPベースの財務指標には制限があり、GAAPに従って作成した当社の連結財務諸表に照らして読む必要があります。これらの非GAAPベースの財務指標の説明は、本プレスリリース内の財務諸表で示しています。また、当社の非GAAPベースの財務指標と、それと最も直接的に比較可能なGAAPベースの財務指標との調整も示しています。投資家の皆様は、この調整を確認されることをお勧めします。 当社の非GAAPベースの財務指標の業績見通しは、株式報酬、OptumSoftおよびCiscoとの訴訟に伴う費用、およびその他の非経常的費用を除きます。当社では、当社の非GAAPベースの粗利益率または非GAAPベースの経常利益率の業績見通しを、GAAPベースの粗利益率またはGAAPベースの経常利益率の業績見通しに照らして調整することは行っていません。当社では、GAAPベースの粗利益率の業績見通し、GAAPベースの経常利益率の業績見通し、またはGAAPベースの粗利益率およびGAAPベースの経常利益率と、非GAAPベースの利益率および非GAAPベースの経常利益率の調整に要するさまざまな現金的項目および非現金項目の業績見通しを提供していないためです。株式報酬費用は、当社の将来の雇用および人材確保のニーズと、当社普通株の将来の公正市場価格の影響を受けます。これらはすべて予測困難であり、常に変化する可能性があります。2016年第4四半期の株式報酬の実額は、当社のGAAPベースの粗利益率とGAAPベースの経常利益率に大きな影響を及ぼします。したがって、非GAAPベースの財務指標の業績見通しを、それに対応するGAAPベースの指標値に照らして調整することは、合理的な労力をもっては不可能です。

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with: Arista Networks’ limited operating history; risks associated with Arista Networks’ rapid growth; Arista Networks’ customer concentration; Arista Networks’ dispute with Cisco Systems, Inc. including Arista Networks’ ability to obtain a determination that alternative product implementations are not covered by remedial orders; Arista Networks’ dispute with OptumSoft, Inc.; requests for more favorable terms and conditions from our large end customers; declines in the sales prices of our products and services; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; increased competition in our products and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; the evolution of the cloud networking market and the adoption by end customers of Arista Networks’ cloud networking solutions; and general market, political, economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect Arista Networks can be found in Arista’s Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, and other filings that the company makes to the SEC from time to time.

Share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of share-based compensation in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 will have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.</p>\n<p><strong>About Arista Networks</strong></p>\n<p>Arista Networks was founded to pioneer and deliver software-driven cloud networking solutions for large data center storage and computing environments.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis (see further explanation below).

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our future performance, including statements in the section entitled “Financial Outlook,” such as estimates regarding revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, statements regarding the ongoing shift to cloud networking, and statements regarding the benefits from the introduction of next-generation telemetry and analytics capabilities. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with: Arista Networks’ limited operating history; risks associated with Arista Networks’ rapid growth; Arista Networks’ customer concentration; Arista Networks’ dispute with Cisco Systems, Inc. including Arista Networks’ ability to obtain a determination that alternative product implementations are not covered by remedial orders; Arista Networks’ dispute with OptumSoft, Inc.; requests for more favorable terms and conditions from our large end customers; declines in the sales prices of our products and services; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; increased competition in our products and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; the evolution of the cloud networking market and the adoption by end customers of Arista Networks’ cloud networking solutions; and general market, political, economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect Arista Networks can be found in Arista’s Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, and other filings that the company makes to the SEC from time to time. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.arista.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof and Arista Networks disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP net income, net income per diluted share, gross margin, or operating margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. The Company’s guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation, expenses associated with the OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, and other non-recurring charges. The Company has not reconciled its non-GAAP gross margin or its non-GAAP operating margin guidance to GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin, because we do not provide guidance on GAAP gross margin or GAAP operating margin or the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin. Share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of share-based compensation in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 will have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.
